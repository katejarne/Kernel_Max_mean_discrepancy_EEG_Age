File results-predictions contain the results applying KMER, KRR and BR  to the Distance matrices or the frequency spectrum
You need to create a plot dir to run the code
-To plot Accuracy bar plots (and sensor projection in the head)
plot_bar_channel_iterator.py  
-To plot MAE (mean absolute error)
plot_bar_channel_iterator_error_mae_ch.py    
-To plot predicted vs real age and delta
plot_correlation_EEG_age_pred_real.py    
-To plot predicted vs real segregated by site and violin plot with errors
plot_correlation_points_color_groups_age_mod.py
