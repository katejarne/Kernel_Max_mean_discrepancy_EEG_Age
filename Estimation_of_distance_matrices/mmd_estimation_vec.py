# Estimation of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for                 #
# each individual with respect to a list. It is used to compute        #
# the distance matrix for each kernel in a set of individuals called   #
# from main_eeg_for_combined.py. Use the empirical MMD definitions for #
#  each kernel in the mmd_def.py library.                              #
