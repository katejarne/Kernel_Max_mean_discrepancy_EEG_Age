# Kernel Max Mean Discrepancy EEG Age

This repository contains code to perform age prediction using EEG from the HarMNqEEG data set and Maximum Mean Discrepancy with different kernels.

## Files included
To plot the results, use the following files:
1. `plot_correlation_EEG_age_pred_real.py`: For correlation between predicted and real age
2. `plot_correlation_points_color_groups_age.py`: For correlation between predicted and real age separating in sites
3. `plot_eeg_head_example.py`: Plot variance in each channel
4. `plot_mmd_distance_matrices.py`: Plot distance matrices
